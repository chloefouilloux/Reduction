Hello!
This is just kind of a fun thing I did a bit haphhazardly. Just wanted some answers to some questions, thought I'd share what the data have to say!

There are 3 files, 
1. **BR_Code**, which is the R code to making the plots
2. **Breast_Reduction_Data** is data for questions I was interested in. You will find there are some empty columns. I was just brainstorming other ideas that could be interesting to look at. Feel free to fill them out, or create your own!
   Note that on the second sheet I put some of the thread URLs of where I was getting the data. I didn't do this super intensively because. . . this is just a silly lil' project and I'm 6dPO?!?
3. **BR-Data.pptx** is just the powerpoint where I arranged the graphs to make the lil' infographic. Also got a lil' lazy in R and just strong-handed some formatting stuffs directly in pptx.
